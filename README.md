# Botany-Web ðŸŒ¿

**Welcome to Botany-Web â€“ your very own terminal gardening game webserver powered by Docker, gotty, and Tailscale!**

## What Is Botany-Web?

Botany-Web is a Dockerized terminal webserver that lets you play [Botany](https://github.com/jifunks/botany) in your browser. It uses [gotty](https://github.com/yudai/gotty) to expose your docker terminal as a web application. Iâ€™ve combined it with [Tailscale+SWAG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uznDiFPlvvM) to securely connect to the terminal webserver on my own domain.

## Features

- Curses-based menu system, optimized for 80x24 terminal
- 20+ Species of plants w/ ASCII art for each
- Persistent aging system that allows your plant to grow even when app is closed
- Multiplayer! Water your friends plants & see who's visited your garden.
- Generations: each plant you bring to its full growth potential rewards you with 20% growth speed for the next plant
